# Quantitative Finance C\+\+ Project


## Introduction

This project wants to replicate the **quant_finance** repository that 
I created using **C++** instead of **Python**. I want to see the differences between coding 
a big quant finance repo in C++ vs Python, in particular I want to verify how faster is C++
compared to Python.

The projects will have a **GUI** built using the **Qt Framework**.

I wanted to create this project using C\+\+20 modules, but, since they are not yet supported by Qt,
I have to use C\+\+17.


## DataFrame Library

I created my own version of the Pandas DataFrame class to use it in C\+\+.
